This repository includes files for the Module 3 Assignment of IBM Data Analyst course on Coursera.

The assignment consisted of two parts:
1. Data visualisation in Excel by creating Pivot Charts.
2. Data visualisation in Looker Studio or IBM Cognos Analytics. I have completed both in order to familiarise myself with both tools.

The instructions for work in Excel are uploaded in the Task List tab. 
The instructions for Looker Studio and IBM Cognos Analytics are provided in the Report_instructions.txt file.

Both Looker Studio and IBM Cognos Analytics are new tools for me and I enjoyed learning both, although I found IBM Cognos Analytics to be more intuitive to use. 
I believe that formatting of the visuals for both parts of the assignment could be improved, however in this case I only followed the instructions.
