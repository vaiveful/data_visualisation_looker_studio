This repository includes files for the Module 3 Assignment of IBM Data Analyst course on Coursera.

The assignment consisted of two parts:
1. Data visualisation in Excel by creating Pivot Charts
2. Data visualisation in Looker Studio.

The instructions for work in Excel are uploaded in the Task List tab and the instructions for Looker Studio are provided in the Looker_studio_instructions.txt file.

Looker Studio is a new tool for me and I enjoyed learning it. I believe that formatting of the visuals for both parts of the assignment could be improved, however I followed the course instructions.
